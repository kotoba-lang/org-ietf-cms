  "[RFC 5652](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5652.html) `SignedData` — parse,
  verify, and build. Portable `.cljc`.

  ## The bug this namespace is mostly written to prevent

  When `signedAttrs` is present, **the signature does not cover the content.** It
  covers the DER of the attributes. The content is reached only through the
  `messageDigest` attribute inside them, and the link exists only if somebody
  checks it.

  So the shape of the mistake is: verify the signature over `signedAttrs`,
  observe that it is cryptographically valid, and report the content as signed —
  without ever comparing `messageDigest` to the digest of the content in hand.
  Every byte of content verifies. Any content verifies.

  `verify-signer-info` therefore refuses when `signedAttrs` is present and either
  required attribute is missing, and it compares them before it looks at the
  signature at all. Three more refusals guard the same seam:

  - **`contentType` must equal `eContentType`.** Without it a signature made over
    an RFC 3161 token (`id-ct-TSTInfo`) can be presented as one made over
    ordinary data — same bytes, different meaning.
  - **A single-valued attribute with more than one value is refused.**
    `messageDigest` is `SET OF` on the wire; a verifier that scans for a value
    that matches lets the signer supply the real digest alongside any other.
  - **Detached content that the caller did not supply is refused**, not treated
    as empty. \"Verified over nothing\" must not read as verified.

  ## Attributes are re-tagged before hashing

  `signedAttrs` travels as `[0] IMPLICIT` and is hashed **as a `SET`** (§5.4).
  `asn1.core/retag` exists for this and drops the parsed `:asn1/der`, so the wire
  bytes cannot be hashed by accident — which would produce a signature no
  conforming verifier accepts, and which a self-consistent implementation would
  never notice.

  ## Injected crypto

  `verify` takes `:digest-fn` and `:verify-fn`. No keys and no algorithm
  registry live here, for the reason `x509.core` and `data-integrity.core` both
  give. `cms.jvm` (`:clj` only) supplies ready-made ones."
